 'Finding Dory' is a swimming success.,positive

" If I wasn't choking back tears, Finding Dory had me laughing until I hurt myself. Oh yes, and it looks amazing, too.",positive
" shares much with last year's blockbuster MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, including the sense that nothing is impossible, including testing the laws of physics to their limits, and a strong message of feminine empowerment",positive
" Dory can fritter away your interest, and the prominence also exposes the limitations of DeGeneres as a voice actor: daffy blather is a cinch for the talk-show host, but she absolutely milks any attempt at pathos.",negative
" Like all Pixar movies (except Cars 2), this has some golden moments that hit you right in the feels.",positive
" ...a solid effort and a nice comeback from last year's The Good Dinosaur, but this is not the best American animated feature we've seen this year.",positive
" For a fish story, ""Finding Dory"" is pretty small scale. Or at least it seems when tossed into the sea with a whopper like ""Finding Nemo."" It simply can't measure up emotionally or narratively. ",neutral
" Finding Dory is as entertaining, soul enriching and bittersweet as any Pixar production to date.",positive
" Efforts like Finding Dory, while perfectly pleasant, do little to quell the feeling that a certain measure of rubber-stamp efficiency has gripped the studio (the superb Inside Out excepted). In other words, welcome to Pixar's cash-grab years.",neutral

 Finding Dory could be funnier. It relies on some callbacks to Finding Nemo and a lot of over-the-top action. But you'd have to have a briny heart to deny there's something special about it.,positive

" From start to fin-ish, 'Finding Dory' is unforgettable. ",positive
" What the film lacks in clean-cut storytelling, though, it more than makes up for in sheer emotionality. Finding Dory is the rare sequel that repurposes the original as a foundation rather than as a cheap form of fan service.",neutral
 A visually marvelous 3-D sequel (but not equal) to the original.,neutral
" Finding Dory isn't just a worthy sequel to Nemo, it also succeeds on its own - as a rousing tale of love and overcoming adversity.",positive
 There are some rollicky moments in Finding Dory... [But] the inventiveness of the animation is not matched by the frayed workmanship of the story line.,neutral
" It's all lovely and sweet, gentle and humane, but it doesn't rise to the creative or emotional heights of its predecessor.",positive
" Loaded with excitement and adrenalin- packed moments, Finding Dory is, as expected, full of humour, largely due to Dory's memory issues and delightfully funny nature.",positive
 It's a quality piece of family animation with a fun finish that hits a few themes you might expect and a few that will surprise you.,neutral
" It's a sequel that's a continuation of the original film rather than an expansion of it, and it is still a success, though not a triumph.",positive
" Finding Dory is charming, very funny, touching and more than a bit repetitive but never a bore.",positive
" The gorgeous, thoughtful, funny Finding Dory is made by the Pixar family for everyone to share with someone they care about, no matter the age, gender, ethnicity -- or even species, for that matter.",positive

 Kudos to Ellen. It's an Oscar-worthy performance. Finding Dory is so well-done and beautifully filmed that you forget the main characters aren't real fish and other sea life. ,positive
 Delightful sequel promotes teamwork; some sadness/scares.,positive
" There may be tears. But remember what Dory says: Just keep swimming, just keep swimming. ",neutral
" DeGeneres has the funny bits down pat...But it's in Dory's quieter moments that (she) breathes a soul into her little blue character: Speaking barely above a whisper, she registers wonder, trepidation and, occasionally, heartbreaking sorrow.",positive
" While it's too similar to the Oscar-winning original to swim completely solo, Finding Dory is a delightful sequel that gives further life to some of Pixar's most loveable characters.",neutral
" The closing credits feature Sia singing Nat King Cole's ""Unforgettable"" - it's a good gag, but I wouldn't go quite that far in describing ""Finding Dory."" Still, it's a delightful film that families will want to remember from time to time.",positive
 A deep sea treasure with endless charms that swim around in your mind.,positive

" Hank the octopus is a particular standout â€_ his mad skills are highly entertaining â€” so entertaining, in fact, that I kind of wish the movie had been about him.",positive
" A sequel that betters the boffo 2003 animated feature Finding Nemo and provides more evidence, after last year's highly original Inside Out, that Pixar has finally emerged from the uninspiring years of the Cars franchise.",positive
" The film is often visually striking and charming enough, but it's low on two things we've come to expect from Pixar: comedy and moving emotional moments.",neutral

 It is a perfectly entertaining film; kids will certainly enjoy it. But that's all it is.,positive

" The ""fish out of water"" theme plays out to Buster Keaton-style excess in the hilarious and adorable Finding Dory.",positive
" Structurally, it's pretty similar to Finding Nemo, and plenty of familiar characters turn up. But the animation strides made in the 13 years between movies are remarkable. Finding Dory looks spectacular.",positive
" Full on action farce that had me trademark Fast and the Fishiest as a new title for the flick, [yet] with PIXAR's latest outing it seems that they're treading water",neutral

 Finding Dory will be a popular summer movie but just don't expect one of their better performances.,positive

" Finding Dory [is] a powerful story of loss and, eventually, improbable triumph.",positive
" We cry not because the movie has tapped into our deepest hopes and fears, but because this is the part where we're supposed to. Dory's catchphrase is ""Just keep swimming,"" but the movie feels like it's just paddling in circles.",neutral

" Where Finding Nemo capitalized on the awesome splendor and danger of the ocean, this follow-up shifts much of its action to an aquatic park and becomes broader and sillier, or at least reality-busting, for it. And, hey, that's OK.",neutral
 Directors Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane make it very clear what you are supposed to feel and when you are supposed to feel it. What they don't do is earn it.,negative
 Fans of the original fishy tale will be delighted to learn that the sequel has most definitely been worth the wait. ,positive

" Hank [the octopus] is one of the best characters Pixar's ever brought to life, aided by O'Neill's grumpy-with-a-heart vocalization. 'Holy carp!' indeed.",positive
 Pixar sequel-phobes be damned - this is a dazzling and technically impressive return to form that delivers a similar high to Finding Nemo without feeling like a retread.,positive
" The movie has plenty of heart and a message which, if not always subtle, remains worth hearing: All of us have strengths and weaknesses, while qualities that disable us in one way might enable us in another.",neutral
" Resisting the temptation to rehash Finding Nemo with new characters as too many sequels do, this fine-finned tale tells a complementary story from the opposite direction.",positive
" ""Finding Dory"" ranks with ""Toy Story 3"" as the animation studio's strongest sequel. The underwater tale manages to be both immersive and buoyant.",positive
" For all the witty voices and great escapes (maybe one too many of the latter), ""Finding Dory"" is ultimately a character story, and DeGeneres' lovable, brave Dory swims right into our hearts.",positive

 Finding Dory follows its predecessor in being broadly concerned with comforting notions of home and family.,neutral

" It rises above its crowded narrative with an intense emotional core, taking a protagonist whose affliction had been played mostly for comedy, and exploring the emptiness and loneliness of her plight.",positive
" Finding Dory, like most ""lesser Pixar,"" is more fun around the edges than the competition tends to be at center.",neutral
" ""Finding Dory"" upholds the Pixar tradition with plenty of inventive humor, cleverly drawn characters and emotionally resonant moments.",neutral
" Of course, ""Dory"" has plot similarities to ""Nemo,"" but there is enough love and care devoted to everything from the characters on down that it works beautifully, even without element of surprise.",positive
" Finding Dory is the kind of enthralling, immersive movie that will have your inner Inside Out crew working overtime handling all the emotions.",positive

" In terms of emotional complexity and character evolution, Finding Dory treads the same water as its predecessor with less success. ",neutral

" DeGeneres's vocal performance is extraordinary, effortlessly shifting from jokes to self-perpetuated anxiety attacks.",neutral
" Never as shattering as Pixar's best and most brutal. In fact, it's almost subtle. But it's the kind of film that dares you to undermine it, just so it can whack you upside the head and steal one more tear.",neutral

" On a scale of Cars 2 to Toy Story 3, Finding Dory is about on par with Monsters University - delivering more of characters that audiences love, while not quite reaching the level of its predecessor.",positive
" Unequivocal joy in cinematic form. There is a reason the delightful ""Finding Nemo"" has become a beloved modern animated classic, and ""Finding Dory"" is headed for the same heralded status.",positive
 It's neither as good as you hoped nor as bad as you feared. ,neutral
" Pixar's wizardry is baked into every detail, from the sun-dappled ocean surfaces to the underwater visuals that border on photorealism. It's unforgettable stuff.",positive
" While the animation is still top-notch and a slew of new waterlogged personalities buoy the story, it doesn't have nearly the same sense of heart, wonder and awe as Nemo.",neutral
 One of the biggest and most pleasant surprises in a film with too few of them is just how resonant Dory will be for parents of kids with learning disabilities.,positive
" After 21 years, the Pixar formula is still very satisfying. But it also feels more like a formula than ever before.",neutral
 Finding Dory is just about as good as Finding Nemo and will probably make you cry. ,positive
